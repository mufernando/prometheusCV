        \begin{itemize}
            \item Developed open source population genetics simulation tools within the \href{https://tskit.dev/software/}{tskit} and \href{https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs/stable/index.html}{stdpopsim} communities (mostly in Python and C++). 
            \item Analyzed population genomic data and used simulations to gain insights into the role of natural selection in shaping genetic variation in the great apes
            \item Developed a machine learning framework that takes tree sequences as input to infer evolutionary processes.
        \end{itemize}
